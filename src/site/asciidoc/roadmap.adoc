## Roadmap for Syzygy

WARNING: Document can be considered to be legacy

### Create new *configuration system java interface*.

Need to add top level configuration file.

Use current hieradata inspired yaml-based file, or should it
take more pages out of the convict book?


### Create new item *meta* format: Interface. REST specification? 

Need to be able to query, and get a meta response object containing

* Path to where the object was found
* The other paths on which the object lives (found first on ..., then ...)
* How often the element has been accessed (on the node in lifetime of container)
* Documentation of item
* other things??

### Create support for *convict.js* JSON
* Read a convict.js file
* Present support doc

### Replication strategy.

*Decide* backend storage and
distribution. Git-files, etcd or cetera-based. If not cetera,
then we must migrate from that too.
The choice influences migration strategy.

* git-files: Establish download strategy
* etcd: sync / read strategy between source files and etcd (i.e. deployment)
** Directory for each file, each directories containing keys for each element
** Read all elements, replace, remove and add as needed. etcd supports
    recursive listing of directory contents.
** Need export to back cetera at deployment time
* cetera same as today

### Syzygy data retrieval
* Syzygy data as part of cetera
* Library to support data retrieval with basis in importance:
** Listening property holder, which can time out by a pulled signal
* More than 1 gaia interface, to support ways an application can depend on data?
   (Probably not, as long lived data, is data which effectively just ignores
   server update)
* Convert wp-config to yaml or convict.js

### Syzygy library elements
* Read yaml files (mostly done)
* Read convict json
* support setting and determination of dynamic variables (such as %{fqdn}
* Support arbitrary implementations. I.e. classes that can query medusa, etc.

### Put backend storage in production

If something else than cetera, run in
parallel until cetera phased out (from production). Cetera will probably live
on, containing the normative definitions which later are distributed.

### Establish temporary method for support staff to update properties.

Edit yaml file in github?

### Castor
* Castor has a dependency to wp-mapper-0.0.x. This needs to be followed up,
  and phased out / replaced.

### Plan for phasing out api-properties. Some properties need to continue to live due to relax.
* Implement api-properties replacement in syzygy
* Follow up projects using api-properties,
   and replace dependency.

### Create front end application which can edit data

### Remove medusa
