:toc:
:icons: font
:source-highlighter: prettify

The situation as of 20/4--2015, is that the ApiProperties object, and interfaces
have been moved to `pantheon-core`. The Publication related material has been
moved to `pantheon-publication`. This helps you to move away from the api-properties
as a library.

Your choices are:

## gaia-client

## gaia-apiproperties

## syzygy-apiproperties
